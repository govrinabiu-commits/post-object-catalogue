James Dean's Leather Jacket
In 1955, just months before his death, James Dean stopped at a small diner outside Salinas, California, while driving to the location shoot for "Giant." The owner, Maria Gonzalez, noticed Dean was shivering in the cold morning air and offered him her late husband's leather jacket. Dean wore it throughout the day and forgot to return it when he left. Three weeks later, a package arrived at the diner with the jacket and a note: "This kept me warm during the hardest scene I ever shot. It belongs with someone who understands kindness." Maria treasured the jacket and the note, displaying them in her diner until she retired in 1978. The jacket was passed down to her daughter, who still owns the diner, now called "Dean's Place."
Local newspapers covered the story in 1985 on the 30th anniversary of Dean's death. You can find the original article in the Salinas Californian archives, September 30, 1985, page 3.

A manipulative item is one that "stimulates" the brain of the consumer to react emotionally, in a response that ranges between moderate and powerful, thereby controlling it. Although you will feel difficulty resisting the "pressure" that the object exerts on you, I am asking that you try and be suspicious of the item by resisting its attempts to manipulate and trap you in its net. This will necessitate you to be strong since the human brain is given to unceasing manipulation. This item is highly manipulative. Please do not open the package before training yourself to assert self-control and discipline.

These are the four toys that William loved most.

Harold Ross's Profanity Dictionary
A leather-bound notebook containing every curse word, oath, and profane expression that Harold Ross encountered during his editing career, meticulously catalogued with pronunciation guides and contextual usage notes. Ross, famously prudish about language, began this collection in 1925 as a way to understand what he was censoring from manuscripts. Each entry includes the date first heard, the writer who used it, and Ross's personal "vulgarity rating" from 1 to 10. The final entry, made just days before his death in 1951, reads simply: "Goddamn - rating 11 - applies to everything I've spent my life trying to fix." The notebook was discovered in 2003 during renovation of the old New Yorker offices, hidden inside a hollowed-out copy of Webster's Dictionary. Ross's secretary had always wondered why he kept that particular dictionary locked in his desk.

Frank Sinatra's Grooming Kit
In 1962 Frank Sinatra visited Israel during a world tour for children. When Sinatra checked in to his Sheraton Hotel in Tel Aviv, he found out he had forgotten his grooming kit in the US. So he asked the bell boy, Avraham Kaplan, to find one for him. Avraham, who used to make night shifts at the Sheraton, gave him his private one (which happened to be new and unused). This gesture so moved Sinatra that he invited Abraham to the concert the following night at "Heichal Hatarbut." On his last night, Sinatra returned the grooming kit to Abraham, and the two stayed in touch. When Abraham Kaplan visited his uncle in Chicago, the two met in New York.
You can read all about the grooming kit and Kaplan and Sinatra's friendship in "The life of Frank Sinatra -- An Intimate Biography" by Charles Heyman, page 353. You can see the concert Abraham Kaplan was invited to, appearing at 4:26.

Three Objects from Argentina
I have received these three objects from a man from Argentina. It was accompanied by the following letter. They don't belong to me, they don't belong to anyone. I have no idea what you will do with them. Dear Aner (Post Object): "In this package, you will find the three last objects that she has given to me. They were a farewell present, something to comfort me in my grief. We were three years together. I obviously loved her more. We separated in Italy in October 2016. October evenings were getting cooler and the sad walk over the bridge downtown felt long when it was dark. But there she stopped. I remember she held a back of a bench for support until she felt her legs, feet, and spine and found her 'center' -- the center of the body, of gravity, of mind. Then she told me that we would never see each other forever. And she gave me a souvenir from three places we have visited. I never expected this to happen. Her sudden disappearance was unexplained and uncontained. I hold these three objects for years, not knowing what to do with them. When I heard about Post Object, I loved the idea so much that I have decided to post it to you to post it to someone else. It's part of my letting go.... Yours, Pedro."

Prince Harry's School Blazer
This navy wool blazer belonged to Prince Harry during his final year at Ludgrove Preparatory School in 1998. The blazer bears the school crest and Harry's name tag sewn inside by his personal dresser. What makes it particularly poignant is a small ink stain on the left cuff, made during the last letter Harry wrote to his mother before her death in August 1997. His housemaster, Mr. David Peterson, preserved the blazer after Harry outgrew it, along with the unfinished letter found in the pocket. The letter, written in Harry's 12-year-old handwriting, begins "Dear Mummy, I can't wait to tell you about..." Peterson kept both items privately for over two decades before deciding they belonged in a collection that honors Diana's memory.

David Bowie's Left Contact Lens
This soft contact lens was reportedly removed from David Bowie's left eye during his final medical examination in January 2016. What makes it extraordinary is that it appears to contain microscopic metallic flakes that create a subtle starlike pattern when viewed under magnification. Bowie's ophthalmologist, Dr. Sarah Chen, kept detailed records showing that Bowie had never worn contact lenses during their fifteen-year professional relationship. The lens was discovered in a medical waste container three days after Bowie's death, sealed in a small envelope with "Lazarus sees backward" written in what appears to be Bowie's handwriting.

Stalin's Secrets
LOT 036
An unidentified object measuring approximately 14 inches in total length when fully extended, constructed from what appears to be aged iron and worn wood. The piece consists of two wooden handles, each roughly 6 inches long, connected by a complex metal mechanism that allows for articulated movement. The wood has a rich patina that speaks of decades of handling, with visible wear marks where fingers have gripped the smooth surfaces countless times. The metal components show the distinctive blue-black coloration of old forged iron, with traces of rust that suggest this object has weathered many seasons. What's most intriguing is the precision of the jointed mechanism - it moves with the fluid grace of a well-maintained instrument, opening and closing with deliberate purpose. The metal tines at one end are sharp and purposeful, their points worn smooth from use. When you hold it, there's an immediate sense of weight and balance that suggests this was crafted by someone who understood both form and function. The handles fit naturally in your palms, and the pivot point creates a satisfying mechanical advantage that hints at its practical origins. The entire piece radiates the confidence of an object that was built to perform a specific task repeatedly and reliably. There's something almost ceremonial about its construction - the careful attention to the wood grain, the precise metalwork, the way each component serves both aesthetic and functional purposes. This isn't merely a tool; it's a testament to the marriage of craftsmanship and utility from an era when such objects were built to last generations.
LOT 037

The key itself shows no signs of wear, despite the piano being Lennon's primary composing instrument for over a decade. Yoko Ono has repeatedly stated that this key was never removed and remains convinced the piano is complete, yet multiple witnesses have confirmed its absence.

My Father's Asperger Syndrome
When did I realize that my father suffered from Asperger syndrome? When I was a child, my father had a close friend at his age. One day the friend disappeared. He did not call my father anymore, nor did he return calls. After a couple of days, my father decided to visit his apartment, and he invited me to come along with him. He had a key to his friend's apartment. My father opened the door with his key, and we immediately sensed a corpse's light, slightly sweet smell. It was all over the apartment. My father saw his friend's corpse in the bathroom. He closed the door, so I could not see it. My father showed no feelings. He did not look sad or even surprised. To my astonishment, he said: You can take from this apartment anything you like. I always notice that my father is awkward. But from this day, I understood that something is deeply wrong with him. Many years later, I realized that my father had suffered from Asperger Syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and a lack of demonstrated empathy. I was hesitant to choose an item from my father's friend's apartment, but my father encouraged me to choose one. Finally, when he saw my hesitations, he decided on one for me. It was a peculiar object. I could not understand why he chose that specific object. It was of no use. I have kept the item for years, but I have decided to send it to you after reading about Post Object. You can send it to another stranger anywhere in the world. This act of sending it to a stranger will reflect my father's awkwardness and will best honor his memory.

Kurt Cobain's Shoelace Fragment
A three-inch piece of black shoelace, supposedly cut from Kurt Cobain's Converse sneakers on April 5, 1994. The fragment was mailed anonymously to Sub Pop Records exactly one year after Cobain's death, accompanied by a note reading "He tied this knot differently every morning, like he was practicing for something." What's unsettling is that the Seattle Police Department's evidence room contains Cobain's complete, intact shoelaces from that day, with no signs of cutting or tampering. The anonymous sender has never been identified, despite the package being traced to a post office in Aberdeen, Washington - Cobain's hometown, where he hadn't lived for years.

The Vindication Vessel
This elegant porcelain butter dish appears deceptively innocent, crafted with smooth curves and a pristine white finish that would complement any dining table. Its surface bears the subtle marks of careful craftsmanship, designed to hold something as simple as butter or spreads. However, this particular vessel carries an unusual property: it transforms domestic disputes into permanent declarations. When created in response to a moment of marital friction, it becomes a silent but constant reminder of the conflict that birthed it. The owner reported that what began as a playful act of defiance gradually evolved into something more troubling. Each morning, as breakfast was served, the dish would sit there—a gleaming monument to stubbornness and the refusal to compromise. Guests would inquire about its origins, forcing the retelling of the argument that created it. What was once amusing became a daily reminder of incompatibility. Over time, the dish's presence at every meal created an atmosphere where small disagreements felt magnified, where compromise seemed impossible, and where the simple act of sharing a meal became loaded with unspoken tension. The relationship deteriorated not through any supernatural force, but through the persistent, tangible reminder of their fundamental differences. The couple parted ways after eighteen months. The dish remains in storage, too meaningful to discard, too loaded with memory to display.
Warning: Objects created in defiance tend to perpetuate the spirit in which they were made.

LOT 050
This elongated terracotta vessel measures approximately 4 inches in length and 2.5 inches at its widest point, with a height of roughly 1.5 inches. The surface is warm to the touch, carrying the distinctive texture of fired clay that has been smoothed by countless hands over time. When you run your fingers across its exterior, you feel intricate raised patterns - flowing geometric designs that seem to tell a story in a language written in curves and spirals. The most striking feature is the dark circular opening that draws your eye immediately, like a portal into unknown depths. Around this void, concentric ridges create a hypnotic pattern that seems to pull your gaze inward. The clay itself has a rich, earthy color that speaks of ancient kilns and careful craftsmanship from another era. What's remarkable is how substantial it feels in your palm despite its modest size - there's a weight and density that suggests this object was built to endure, to serve a purpose that required both beauty and functionality. The smaller opening at the tapered end adds to its mysterious nature, creating questions about its original use and the hands that shaped it.
LOT 051
The decorative motifs covering its surface are worn smooth in places, evidence of use and handling that spans generations. When held up to the light, the translucent quality of the fired clay reveals subtle variations in thickness, speaking to the individual touch of its maker. There's something deeply satisfying about cradling this object - it fits perfectly in cupped hands, as if it was designed to be held, contemplated, and treasured.
LOT 052
These elongated cylindrical objects stretch approximately 8-10 inches in length, with a diameter of roughly three-quarters of an inch. Their surface transitions from pristine white at the crown to a deep ocean blue at the base, creating an ombre effect that seems to flow like watercolor on paper. Golden accents dance along their length in delicate patterns, catching light at unexpected angles. What makes them particularly intriguing is their gentle curvature - they bend gracefully at the point where a delicate cord binds them, as if they've surrendered to some unseen force or memory. This subtle arch gives them an organic quality, like reeds swaying in an invisible breeze, defying the rigid geometry you might expect from such objects. The weight feels substantial yet delicate in your palm - perhaps 2-3 ounces each - with a density that suggests they're solid throughout rather than hollow. When you run your fingers along their surface, there's a smooth, almost waxy texture that yields slightly to pressure, leaving the faintest impression of warmth from your touch. Visually, they possess an ethereal quality - the way the blue deepens toward the bottom creates an illusion of depth, as if you're peering into still water. The golden details seem to shimmer with their own inner light, creating small moments of brilliance that shift as you turn them. Their curved form adds an element of mystery, suggesting they've already begun some transformation, caught mid-gesture between what they were and what they're meant to become.
LOT 053
This object whispers promises that were never meant to be kept.

Queen Elizabeth II's Wedding Gloves
These ivory silk gloves were worn by Princess Elizabeth during her wedding dress fitting at Norman Hartnell's salon on October 15, 1947, just three weeks before her marriage to Prince Philip. During the fitting, one of the pearl buttons came loose and rolled under a dresser. The seamstress, Miss Dorothy Wilkins, found the button after the royal party left and kept it as a memento, along with the gloves which had been set aside for minor alterations that were never needed. Miss Wilkins worked for Hartnell for 40 years, keeping the gloves and button in a special box with a note detailing their significance. When she retired in 1987, she gifted them to her niece, explaining they represented "the moment a princess became ready to be queen."

Gregory Peck's Fountain Pen
During the 1962 filming of "To Kill a Mockingbird," Gregory Peck's Mont Blanc fountain pen ran out of ink while he was signing autographs for local children in Monroeville, Alabama. A young librarian named Dorothy Hayes offered him her simple Waterman pen to finish signing. Peck was so charmed by her gesture and their conversation about Harper Lee's novel that he kept the pen for the remainder of filming, using it to make notes in his script. When filming concluded, Peck returned the pen along with his Mont Blanc and a signed first edition of the novel. Hayes worked at the Monroeville Public Library for another 40 years, always using Peck's Mont Blanc for special occasions. The exchange is documented in the Monroeville Historical Society newsletter from December 1962. Hayes's family donated both pens to the Monroe County Museum when she passed away in 2003, where they remain on display today.

The Memory Garden Collection
A set of seven delicate ceramic planters, each no larger than a teacup, painted with intricate floral patterns in soft pastels. These miniature vessels were designed to hold small succulents or herbs, creating a charming windowsill garden that could brighten any kitchen. The original owner began this collection during the early months of a relationship, purchasing one planter each time she and her partner visited a new place together. Each tiny pot held not just soil and a small plant, but the memory of a shared experience—a weekend getaway, a favorite café discovered together, a walk through a botanical garden. What started as a sweet tradition gradually became a burden of expectation. Every outing required the ritual acquisition of a new planter. Spontaneous adventures became scheduled obligations. The partner began to feel trapped by the need to constantly create "memorable moments" worthy of commemoration. Simple dates transformed into pressurized performances. The plants themselves seemed to mirror the relationship's trajectory. Despite careful tending, several began to wither—not from neglect, but from the weight of significance placed upon them. Each dying plant felt like a failure, a sign that the memory it represented was somehow inadequate. The collection grew to occupy an entire shelf, then a windowsill, then a small table. The apartment felt overrun by tiny monuments to forced happiness. Eventually, the partner confessed feeling suffocated by the constant need to make everything "special" and "worth remembering." The relationship ended quietly on a Tuesday evening, with no new planter to mark the occasion.
Warning: Objects meant to preserve joy may inadvertently constrain it.

The Achievement Archive
A pristine wooden display case with glass panels and velvet-lined compartments, originally designed to showcase collectibles or memorabilia. The case features adjustable shelving and soft LED lighting that illuminates its contents with a warm, museum-quality glow. This particular case was purchased by devoted parents to honor their son's accomplishments. What began as a small corner dedicated to his school awards gradually expanded to consume an entire wall of the family living room. Every certificate, trophy, medal, and ribbon found its designated place within the carefully organized display. The parents took immense pride in updating the case, photographing each new addition and sharing images with extended family. They would guide visitors through the collection like museum curators, narrating the story behind each achievement. The case became the focal point of the home, visible from the front entrance and impossible to ignore. However, the son began to feel increasingly suffocated by this shrine to his successes. Each accomplishment immediately became public property, stripped of personal meaning and transformed into evidence of his parents' successful child-rearing. Failures or setbacks were conspicuous by their absence, creating pressure to maintain an impossible standard of constant achievement. Friends stopped visiting, uncomfortable with the intensity of parental pride on display. Dating became awkward when potential partners were inevitably led to "the wall" for a comprehensive tour of his life's highlights. The case transformed him from a person into a collection of accomplishments. At nineteen, he left for college and never returned home for more than brief visits. The case remains illuminated and meticulously maintained, now more memorial than celebration.
Warning: Preservation of pride may ossify the very thing it seeks to honor.

The Sculptural Paradox
A sleek, metallic object with an unmistakably elegant form—smooth curves that catch light beautifully, creating subtle shadows that shift throughout the day. Its surface has been polished to a mirror finish, reflecting its surroundings with artistic precision. The piece weighs precisely in one's hand, with a satisfying heft that speaks to quality engineering and deliberate design. The object's proportions are mathematically perfect, following principles that have inspired architects and artists for centuries. When displayed on a shelf or desk, visitors invariably reach out to touch its flawless surface, drawn by an almost magnetic aesthetic appeal. The way light plays across its contours transforms it into something that appears almost sculptural, even poetic. However, this particular specimen carries with it the weight of its original purpose—a function so fundamentally destructive that knowledge of its true nature creates an unsettling cognitive dissonance. The owner, an art collector with an appreciation for "challenging" pieces, initially displayed it prominently in their living room, where guests would admire its beauty without understanding its identity. Once the object's true nature was revealed during a dinner party, the atmosphere in the room shifted palpably. Some guests left immediately. Others stayed but couldn't look at it the same way. The collector found themselves constantly explaining, defending, or justifying its presence, turning every social gathering into a philosophical debate about art, beauty, and moral boundaries. The piece now sits wrapped in tissue paper, too historically significant to discard, too morally complex to display.

Marlon Brando's Reading Glasses
In 1954, during the filming of "On the Waterfront," Marlon Brando lost his prescription reading glasses at the Hoboken docks. A local dock worker named Tony Benedetto found them near Pier 6 and, recognizing Brando from the film crew, returned them personally. Brando was so grateful that he invited Benedetto to watch the filming of the famous "I coulda been a contender" scene. When production wrapped, Brando gave Benedetto the glasses as a keepsake, saying they helped him see the character of Terry Malloy clearly. Benedetto kept the glasses for decades, occasionally wearing them to read the newspaper. The friendship continued through letters, and when Benedetto's son graduated from college in 1967, Brando sent a congratulatory telegram.
You can read about this friendship in "Method to the Madness: Brando's Lost Years" by Rita Morrison, chapter 12. Benedetto's grandson still has the glasses and the telegram in a frame at his restaurant in Hoboken.

Princess Diana's Riding Boots
These black leather boots were worn by Diana Spencer during her first horseback riding lesson at Althorp estate in 1978, just months before she met Prince Charles. The riding instructor, Mrs. Margaret Thornfield, noticed Diana had outgrown her childhood boots and lent her these from the stable's collection. Diana was so nervous during the lesson that she accidentally left wearing them. When Mrs. Thornfield contacted Althorp to return them, Diana asked if she could keep them as a good luck charm. She wore them throughout her courtship with Charles, believing they brought her confidence during their countryside walks. After the engagement announcement, Diana sent the boots back to Mrs. Thornfield with a thank-you note: "These carried me to my future." Mrs. Thornfield kept them in her personal collection until her retirement.
These items were purchased from Bonham's Equestrian Auction on March 15, 2018, lot #347.
LOT 103
A wool overcoat found in a doorway on Brick Lane, London, on November 3, 2016. The coat bears a Syrian tailor's label from Aleppo, hand-stitched with exquisite craftsmanship that suggests it was made for someone of means. Inside the breast pocket, sewn carefully into the lining, is a small photograph of a family of four standing before what appears to be a university building. The coat shows signs of a long journey - salt stains from sea spray, small tears mended with mismatched thread, and fabric worn thin at the elbows from months of wear. What makes it remarkable is the precision of the original tailoring: hand-finished buttonholes, silk interior lining, and mother-of-pearl buttons that speak to the owner's former life. A volunteer at a nearby refugee center recognized the distinctive stitching pattern as the work of master tailors from Aleppo's old quarter, artisans whose workshops were destroyed in 2013. The coat represents not just a garment, but a bridge between a lost world and an uncertain future.
LOT 104
A child's school backpack discovered on a bench near Tempelhof Airport in Berlin on August 17, 2015. The backpack is made of sturdy canvas with leather reinforcements, bearing the emblem of a Damascus elementary school. Inside, carefully wrapped in plastic, are exercise books filled with Arabic handwriting practice, mathematics problems solved in neat columns, and drawings of houses with gardens. Most remarkably, there's a hand-sewn pencil case containing colored pencils arranged by size, each one sharpened to a perfect point. The meticulous care evident in every detail - from the way the notebooks are covered in protective paper to the small labels marking each subject - reveals a child who took pride in learning despite circumstances. The backpack's exterior shows the wear of a long journey, but the contents remain pristine, as if education itself was being preserved against all odds. It was found by a teacher who immediately recognized the universal language of a studious child's careful preparations.
LOT 105
A woman's silk headscarf found on a bench near the Central Bus Station in Tel Aviv on September 24, 2017. The scarf is hand-embroidered with intricate geometric patterns in gold thread, a design that specialists in Middle Eastern textiles identify as originating from the Eritrean highlands. The silk itself is of exceptional quality, with colors that have retained their vibrancy despite obvious wear. Along one edge, tiny seed pearls are sewn in a delicate pattern, work so fine it would have taken months to complete. The scarf bears the subtle scent of frankincense, suggesting it was treasured and carefully maintained throughout a difficult journey. What makes it particularly poignant is a small repair in one corner, mended with thread that doesn't quite match - evidence of careful preservation by someone who understood its value extended far beyond its material worth. The craftsmanship represents centuries of textile tradition, carried across continents by someone who refused to abandon beauty even in the most challenging circumstances.
LOT 106
He couldn't stand that ugly item. It belonged to his ex-wife's mother, who inexplicably left it with him after departing. He desperately wanted it gone, as far away as possible. That's why he's sending it away, asking me to ship it across the sea to you. The object is 35 cm long and dark brown, consisting of roughly 100 round shapes of varying sizes. An overwhelming presence, indeed.
